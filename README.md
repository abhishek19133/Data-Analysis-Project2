                                                     **TATA Retail Store Data Analysis**
**Project Overview**

This project is based on a **real-time simulation** provided by **TATA and The Forage**. The simulation involves analyzing the performance of TATA's online retail store. The goal is to generate insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and demand across different regions to support strategic decision-making and business expansion.

TATA Retail Store has hired me as a Data analyst in simulation to analyze sales data and generate insights that will help in making strategic decisions for the business. The analysis focuses question asked by CEO and CMO on both operational and marketing perspectives, identifying trends, high-performing areas, and regions with expansion potential.

**Question asked**

**Question 1**
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

**Question 2**
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

**Question 3**
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

**Question 4**
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

**Tools Used**

Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, manipulation, and basic analysis.

Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to present the insights.

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

1.Cleaned the raw sales dataset by removing duplicates , removing unnecessary coloumn, handling missing values by mean , and transforming data into a structured format, fix data types,trim whitespaces and chage value as per requirement like change quantity value from 0 to 1, and Negative value also change as per requirnemnt .

2.Performed basic statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns using pivot table.

**Data Visualization:**

1.Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters to explore key metrics like sales performance, product analysis, and regional trends.

2.The dashboard allows users to drill down into specific data points and analyze performance by different categories.

**Insights**

1.Revenue Trends: Monthly revenue exhibits seasonal patterns, likely influenced by holidays or promotional periods. These insights can help forecast next year's performance.

2.Geographic Expansion: The analysis reveals countries outside the United Kingdom that are performing well, presenting opportunities for expansion in those markets.

3.Customer Retention: Targeting the top 10 revenue-generating customers can improve retention and satisfaction, boosting long-term revenue.

4.Regional Focus for Expansion: The demand visualization highlights regions with high potential for expansion. The CEO can use this data to refine the expansion strategy.

**Certification**

This project is part of a real-time simulation for which certification was awarded by TATA and The Forage upon successful completion. The simulation reflects a real-world business scenario, providing hands-on experience in analyzing sales data and generating actionable insights.
